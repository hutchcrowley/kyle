Bugs:

Modularize the code in Index.html

Before the test cases are displayed:

The Sesame text box does not by default display the item you clicked on

Formatting is crap

Need to apply Sesame to Steps

Got that extra colon that appears at bottom of div  **RESOLVED**

When the test cases are displayed:

Being able to sit there, change you parameters, and rerender your test cases is HUGE. Right now, it ain't really happenin'

Need need need to be able to export to .csv

The top is too close to the list of test steps.

If you have completed the entire process and printed test cases, then go back and select a different data type, the datatype component
does not display.

Adding a step then clicking for test cases creates too many test cases
